Getting the feel of JS to see if its a suitable career path for me

### 6.12.24 
Today i went over introduction to JavaScript and researched the language.  
I followed the JavaScript roadmap on roadman.sh and covered the following:  
  What is JavaScript  
  History of JavaScript  
  JavaScript versions  
  How to run JavaScript

### 8.12.24  
Went over JS and html syntax. Tried writing code in google js console. Set up the environment in vscode to work with js, html and css.  

### 9.12.24  
JavaScript runs in the order it appears in your HTML file. To avoid issues:
  1. Place <script> tags at the end of the <body> (simple approach).
  2. Use defer or DOMContentLoaded for more control in larger projects.
This ensures your JavaScript code interacts with elements that are already loaded into the DOM.

Covered variables in JS  

JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain.  


### 9.12.24  
Variables declared OUTSIDE the block or a function are LOCAL variables 
Variables declared INSIDE the block or a function are GLOBAL variables 
 
Built in objects 
Built-in objects, or “global objects”, are those built into the language specification itself. There are numerous built-in objects with the JavaScript language, all of which are accessible at the global scope. They are used to speed up coding by performing certain actions with/out variables through METHODS or by returning information about variables through PROPERTIES. 
 
Built-in objects are equivalent of other programming languages built-in functions. Some examples are: 
 
Number 
Math 
Date 
String 
Error 
Function 
Boolean
